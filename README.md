This is a SARIMA and ARIMA model to predict palm oil prices

A Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is a time series forecasting technique that extends ARIMA by accounting for seasonality in data. It combines autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components with seasonal counterparts to capture both short-term and long-term patterns. SARIMA is valuable for predicting time series data with recurring seasonal variations, making it useful in various fields, such as economics and finance, where seasonality plays a crucial role in the data's behavior.
